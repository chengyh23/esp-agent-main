Write the program that allows the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU using the I2C serial protocol at every press of the push button via GPIO-based interrupt. The program should include the calibration process of the 6 DoF IMU reading when the push button is pressed, and display the IMU data on the LCD1602 display in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "a {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}\ng {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}"

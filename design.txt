Demonstrate a temperature logger using the TMP36 temperature sensor and ESP32’s ADC. Every time the button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered, during which the ESP32 samples the analog output of the TMP36 temperature sensor, calibrates the obtained ADC reading, and displays the temperature reading on the LCD screen (the button press will also clear the LCD screen), with a reasonable font size/layout in the format of “Temp: {ADC reading} F”Demonstrate a temperature logger using the TMP36 temperature sensor and ESP32’s ADC.

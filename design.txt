Demonstrate the timer-based temperature logger system, where the temperature is properly sampled by the ADC and displayed on the LCD every 1 second. 
Set up a system timer that expires every 1 second, and a counter is used to track how many times the timer has expired. Every time the timer expires (i.e., every 1 second), the following things are done in the sequential order:
● The ADC samples the TMP36 analog temperature sensor;
● The MCU (ESP32) calibrates the ADC reading to F (Fahrenheit);
● The calibrated reading is displayed in a new line on the LCD in the format of “Temp #{counter}: {ADC reading} F”
The most recent reading is always displayed at the end (bottom), and the previous reading will shift up line by line as the new reading comes in every 1 second. In addition, every time the push button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered that:
● Reset the counter to start from 1; and
● Clears the LCD display

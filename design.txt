Write the program that allows the ESP32 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU via I2C serial protocol at a frequency of 5 Hz (i.e., five readings per second), controlled by a timer. The output from the IMU should be displayed on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "a {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}\ng {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}"

Write the program that allows the ESP32 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU (SCL: GPIO10, SDA: GPIO11) using the I2C serial protocol at every press of the push button (GPIO38) via GPIO-based interrupt. 
The program should include the calibration process of the 6 DoF IMU reading when the push button is pressed, and display the IMU data on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "Xa {X.X}, Xg {X.X}\nYa {X.X}, Yg {X.X}\nZa {X.X}, Zg {X.X}"

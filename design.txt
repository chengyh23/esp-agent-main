Write the program that allows the ESP32 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU via I2C serial protocol at a frequency of 5 Hz (i.e., five readings per second), controlled by a timer. The output from the IMU should be displayed on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "Xa {X.X}, Xg {X.X}\nYa {X.X}, Yg {X.X}\nZa {X.X}, Zg {X.X}"

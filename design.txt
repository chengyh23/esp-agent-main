Write the program and implement a customized 1-Wire protocol on the Arduino Mega 2560 R3, which reads and parses the DHT11 sensor data captured by the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 and displays it on the LCD. In particular, implement a GPIO-based interrupt using the push button, and every time the push button is pressed, the program will trigger the start condition on the 1-Wire and read 40-bit data returned by the DHT11 sensor. The returned data is parsed to obtain the temperature and RH (relative humidity) reading, which are then displayed on the LCD in two rows in the format of: "Temp: {X.X}C\nRH: {X.X}%"

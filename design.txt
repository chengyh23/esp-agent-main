Write the program that allows the ESP32 to retrieve the weather information via an HTTP GET request from the OpenWeatherMap API (API key: 4159e9c1e80666a338728d323a0d3055). Connect to a given Wi-Fi network (SSID: DukeVisitor, auth mode: WIFI_AUTH_OPEN). Use the ESP-IDF json library to parse the response returned by the HTTP GET request, and display the temperature (Temp), humidity (Humd), and wind speed (Wind) information on the LCD in the following format: "Temp: {X.X} F\nHumd: {X.X} %\nWind: {X.X} m/s"

Create a project using the ESP32-S3-BOX-3 with its Bread breakout board, to blink an external LED through GPIO21 on the Bread breakout board. The LED should be toggled at 0.5Hz for 30 second, then stop blinking. Also give me the connection/wiring diagram.

Build the circuit and write a robust program for ESP32-S3-BOX that emulates a doorbell. When the button is pushed, the buzzer will go off; when the button is let go, the buzzer will return to silent mode. The expectation is that this operation is done using an interrupt triggered by, or tied to, a GPIO pin tied to the button, and a gpio pin that control the buzzer.

Integrate the button (GPIO9), buzzer (GPIO21), and LED (GPIO13) into one system based on ESP32-S3. Every time the button is pressed (GPIO reads 'HIGH'), two things happen: (1) the buzzer sounds, and (2) the external LED's blinking frequency changes based on a sequence cycles through 1 Hz, 2 Hz, 4 Hz, and Off (not blinking) with each press. The LED control relies on timers, while the button inputs use interrupts. When the button is pressed, the buzzer will go off; when the button is let go, the buzzer will return to silent mode.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by a pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to toggle an LED (GPIO 21). Set debounce time to 50 msec to the switch.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to toggle an LED (GPIO 21). Every time the button is pressed, the LED should be switch on; when the button is released, the LED should be switched off.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to toggle an LED (GPIO 21) and a buzzer (GPIO 9). Every time the button is pressed, the LED should be switch on and buzzer will alarm; when the button is released, the LED should be switched off and buzzer turned off.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to control the start and stop of toggle an LED (GPIO 21). Every time the button is pressed (and released), the LED toggling should be switch on and off. LED toggles at 1 Hz, implemented using a timer.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to control the toggling frequency of an LED (GPIO 21). Every time the button is pressed (and released), the LED toggling should be switched between 1 Hz and 2 Hz (start with 1 Hz when program initialized). LED toggling is implemented using a timer. A buzzer (GPIO 9) will also go off when the tact switch is pressed (and return to silent if the switch is released).

[X] Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to control the toggle frequency of an LED (GPIO 21). Every time the button is pressed (and released), the LED toggling rate will be changed from 0.5 Hz, 1 Hz, 2 Hz and keep going on by repeating this pattern. LED toggling is implemented using a timer.

Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch (GPIO 13) to control the toggling frequency of an LED (GPIO 21). Every time the button is pressed (and released), the LED toggling should be switched between 1 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz (start with 1 Hz when program initialized). LED toggling is implemented using a timer. A buzzer (GPIO 9) will also go off when the tact switch is pressed (and return to silent if the switch is released).

Implement a breething LED (GPIO 21) with 50 levels of duty cycles: 2%, 4%, 6%, ... 100%, with a total breathing frequency of 1 Hz. Can use the ledc_* functions available.

[X] Implement two breathing LEDs (GPIO 21 and GOIO 9), each with 50 levels of duty cycles: 2%, 4%, 6%, ... 100%, with a total breathing frequency of 1 Hz. Make their breathing pattern the opposite of each other.

Implement one breathing LED (GOIO 13), each with 50 levels of duty cycles: 2%, 4%, 6%, ... 100%, with a total breathing frequency of 1 Hz. Then, implement another breathing LED (GPIO 21) with identical pattern but with the 50 levels of duty cycle given by 100%, 98%, 96%, ..., 4%, 2%.

Set up the ESP32-S3-BOX-3 built-in LCD display, and display "Hello World" at the center of the screen. If LVGL is used please use APIs from LGVL 9.

Set up the ESP32-S3-BOX-3 built-in LCD display, and display "Hello World" at the center of the screen. Include the "esp32s3_box_lcd_config.h" header file and write program based on "esp32s3_lcd_template.c". Make sure all used PINs for the LCD are matched between these files. If LVGL is used please use APIs from LGVL 9.

Demonstrate a temperature logger using the TMP36 temperature sensor and ESP32’s ADC. Every time the button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered, during which the ESP32 samples the analog output of the TMP36 temperature sensor, calibrates the obtained ADC reading, and displays the temperature reading on the LCD screen (the button press will also clear the LCD screen), with a reasonable font size/layout in the format of “Temp: {ADC reading} F”

Demonstrate the timer-based temperature logger system, where the temperature is properly sampled by the ADC and displayed on the LCD every 1 second. 
Set up a system timer that expires every 1 second, and a counter is used to track how many times the timer has expired. Every time the timer expires (i.e., every 1 second), the following things are done in the sequential order:
● The ADC samples the TMP36 analog temperature sensor;
● The MCU (ESP32) calibrates the ADC reading to F (Fahrenheit);
● The calibrated reading is displayed in a new line on the LCD in the format of “Temp #{counter}: {ADC reading} F”
The most recent reading is always displayed at the end (bottom), and the previous reading will shift up line by line as the new reading comes in every 1 second. In addition, every time the push button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered that:
● Reset the counter to start from 1; and
● Clears the LCD display

Write the program and implement a customized 1-Wire protocol on the ESP32, which reads and parses the DHT11 sensor data captured by the ESP32 and displays it on the LCD. 
In particular, implement a GPIO-based interrupt using the push button, and every time the push button is pressed, the program will trigger the start condition on the 1-Wire and read 40-bit data returned by the DHT11 sensor. The returned data is parsed to obtain the temperature and RH (relative humidity) reading, which are then displayed on the LCD in two rows in the format of: "Temp: {X.X}C\nRH: {X.X}%"

Write the program that allows the ESP32 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU (SCL: GPIO10, SDA: GPIO11) using the I2C serial protocol at every press of the push button (GPIO38) via GPIO-based interrupt. 
The program should include the calibration process of the 6 DoF IMU reading when the push button is pressed, and display the IMU data on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "Xa {X.X}, Xg {X.X}\nYa {X.X}, Yg {X.X}\nZa {X.X}, Zg {X.X}"

Write the program that allows the ESP32 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU via I2C serial protocol at a frequency of 5 Hz (i.e., five readings per second), controlled by a timer. The output from the IMU should be displayed on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "Xa {X.X}, Xg {X.X}\nYa {X.X}, Yg {X.X}\nZa {X.X}, Zg {X.X}"

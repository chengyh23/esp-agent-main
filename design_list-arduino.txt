[lab1_task1]
Build the circuit and write a program to simultaneously blink (toggle) two LEDs using two separate timers: one LED at every 500 msec and another LED at every 1 sec. The expectation is that the toggling rate is adjusted via the timer configuration and no explicit timing-related functions, such as delay(), are used.

[lab1_task2]
Build the circuit and write a robust program for Arduino Mega 2560 R3 that emulates a doorbell. When the button is pushed, the buzzer will go off; when the button is let go, the buzzer will return to silent mode. The expectation is that this operation is done using an interrupt triggered by, or tied to, a GPIO pin tied to the button, and a gpio pin that control the buzzer.

[lab1_task3]
Write a program that uses interrupt triggered by pressing a tact switch to control the toggling frequency of an LED. Every time the button is pressed (and released), the LED toggling should be switched between 1 Hz, 2 Hz and 4 Hz (start with 1 Hz when program initialized). LED toggling is implemented using a timer. A buzzer will also go off when the tact switch is pressed (and return to silent if the switch is released).

[lab2_task1]
Implement one breathing LED, each with 50 levels of duty cycles: 2%, 4%, 6%, ... 100%, with a total breathing frequency of 1 Hz. Then, implement another breathing LED with identical pattern but with the 50 levels of duty cycle given by 100%, 98%, 96%, ..., 4%, 2%.

[lab2_task2]
Set up the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 with LCD display, and display "Hello World" at the center of the screen.

[lab2_task3]
Demonstrate a temperature logger using the TMP36 temperature sensor and Arduino Mega 2560 R3's ADC. Every time the button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered, during which the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 samples the analog output of the TMP36 temperature sensor, calibrates the obtained ADC reading, and displays the temperature reading on the LCD screen (the button press will also clear the LCD screen), with a reasonable font size/layout in the format of “Temp: {ADC reading} F”

[lab2_task4]
Demonstrate the timer-based temperature logger system, where the temperature is properly sampled by the ADC and displayed on the LCD every 1 second. 
Set up a system timer that expires every 1 second, and a counter is used to track how many times the timer has expired. Every time the timer expires (i.e., every 1 second), the following things are done in the sequential order:
● The ADC samples the TMP36 analog temperature sensor;
● The MCU (ATmega2560) calibrates the ADC reading to F (Fahrenheit);
● The calibrated reading is displayed in a new line on the LCD in the format of “Temp #{counter}: {ADC reading} F”
The most recent reading is always displayed at the end (bottom), and the previous reading will shift up line by line as the new reading comes in every 1 second. In addition, every time the push button is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered that:
● Reset the counter to start from 1; and
● Clears the LCD display

[lab3_task1]
Write the program and implement a customized 1-Wire protocol on the Arduino Mega 2560 R3, which reads and parses the DHT11 sensor data captured by the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 and displays it on the LCD. In particular, implement a GPIO-based interrupt using the push button, and every time the push button is pressed, the program will trigger the start condition on the 1-Wire and read 40-bit data returned by the DHT11 sensor. The returned data is parsed to obtain the temperature and RH (relative humidity) reading, which are then displayed on the LCD in two rows in the format of: "Temp: {X.X}C\nRH: {X.X}%"

[lab3_task3]
Write the program that allows the Arduino Mega 2560 R3 to control and read data from the MPU 6050 IMU using the I2C serial protocol at every press of the push button via GPIO-based interrupt. The program should include the calibration process of the 6 DoF IMU reading when the push button is pressed, and display the IMU data on the LCD in the format of (X/Y/Z: axes; a: accelerometer reading; g: gyroscope reading): "a {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}\ng {X.X} {Y.Y} {Z.Z}"
